title: Collaborate on code with patches
---

With patches, Radicle's equivalent to pull requests, you can collaborate with contributors on changes to your shared
project in a way that's more intuitive than Git's CLI tools.

We'll cover the entire collaboration process using patches, from both the contributor and maintainer's perspectives.


The Radicle [web app](https://app.radicle.xyz) will support reviewing and approving patches in the future, but for now,
they work only on the CLI.

:::caution

This document details an experimental feature that's still undergoing active development. There will likely be bugs and
breaking changes.

:::

## Contributor: Create a patch

If you haven't already, [clone](using-radicle/clone.md) the project you want to collaborate on. Make a change, commit
it, and push it to your remote:

```bash
git add <filename>
git commit -m "<your commit message>"
rad push
```

Create your patch and verify the commits you'd like to add to your patch:

```
rad patch --sync
```

Verify the commits you'd like to add to your patch by hitting `Y`. `rad` opens a text file for you to edit the title and
description of your patch. The title of your patch goes on the first line, and your description starts on the third
line, with one blank line between them. For example:

```
Tweak the README

This patch makes a small edit to the README as an example of how patches work in Radicle.

<!--
Please enter a patch message for your changes. An empty
message aborts the patch proposal.

The first line is the patch title. The patch description
follows, and must be separated with a blank line, just
like a commit message. Markdown is supported in the title
and description.
-->
```

`rad` asks you to verify the patch and hit `Y` again if you like what you see. It then syncs your local project state
with your remote, allowing others to track and review the work you've done.

### View your patches

View your proposed patches (and those proposed by others) with `rad patch --list`.

```
$ rad patch --list

â””â”€â”€ hnrky9tzysh opened by docs-tester Fri, 16 Sep 2022 18:59:37 +0000  you 

 OTHERS PROPOSED 

Nothing to show.
```

## Maintainer: Track, review and merge the patch

To review and merge patches, you first need to find any changes to your project that have been published on the Radicle
network through other remotes.

Run `rad track` to return a list of remotes on your project.

```bash
$ rad track
radicle-example rad:git:hnrkmkfqk1yadewcgasm1s6mp5pn1hc5ch6wy (local)
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ hynh7gxq3u1c7gu7wupyw99k16tz5td8n6tmwdy9s1xcfwn6zucqfy docs-tester
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main bcb1e5cda1aba650e986ede87f9496bab457720a 
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ hyyc74e14b4pddma6jko8385cnjdj154aorp71456gqb4o5uqwkwpk joelhans  delegate   you 
    â””â”€â”€ main e2cc2f98df61de3503edfcf6904993add918cda6
```

In the example above, you can see the canonical main branch at the bottom, managed by "`you`", the project's single
delegate, in addition to two additional source trees from collaborators.

Let's say you want to track the patch from the `docs-tester` user.

Use `rad track <peer-id>` to track the remote peer from your local working copy.

```
$ rad track hynh7gxq3u1c7gu7wupyw99k16tz5td8n6tmwdy9s1xcfwn6zucqfy
ðŸŒ± Establishing tracking relationship for rad:git:hnrkmkfqk1yadewcgasm1s6mp5pn1hc5ch6wy...
ok Tracking relationship hynh7gxq3u1c7gu7wupyw99k16tz5td8n6tmwdy9s1xcfwn6zucqfy established
ok Syncing peer refs from willow.radicle.garden...
ok Remote-tracking branch peer/docs-tester/main created for hynh7gxâ€¦6zucqfy
```

This sets up a remote in your working copy and a tracking branch named after the peer and project's default branch. In
this example, the tracking branch is `peer/docs-tester/main`, which you can see in the last line of the above output.

### Review the patch

Next, list the patches.

```
rad patch --list

TK
TK
```

Review the patch with `rad review`.

```
rad review --accept PATCH --message "LGTM."
```

> **Does `rad review` let you view a diff?**

### Merge and push to the canonical branch

```
rad merge <patch>
```

```
rad push
```

## Contributor: Pull the changes

As a contributor, you can now see the fruits of your labor by pulling the changed codebase back into your local copy.
And with the state of both remotes at the same `HEAD` you can continue collaborating with additional patches.

Check out the maintainer's branch.

```
git checkout peers/<maintainer>/<master/main>
```

> **Why not `rad checkout`?**

Pull the changes from their branch to your local working copy.

```
rad pull
```
